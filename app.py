Types of Design Patterns:
1. Creational Patterns: These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms.
   - Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - Factory Method: Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
   - Abstract Factory: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2. Structural Patterns: These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
   - Adapter: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
   - Bridge: Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
   - Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

3. Behavioral Patterns: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities.
   - Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
   - Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
   - Command: Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.""",

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
   - When a class handles multiple responsibilities, it becomes coupled, making it more difficult to maintain.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
   - Using interfaces and abstract classes helps follow this principle."""
